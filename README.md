# Welcome to the Falcon Compiler!

The Falcon Compiler is a JS compiler for the class defined language and grammar for CMPT 432N.



### Grading Material

All lab files can be found on the **master** branch, in their respective folders.

*ex: Lab 0 can be found under path Labs/Lab 0/Lab0.pdf*

Project files and test cases can be found within branches named for each project, such as **prj1**, **prj2**, **prj3**, and **prj4**. Once each part of the project is complete and no longer needs adjustments, the project branch will be merged with the **master** branch.
