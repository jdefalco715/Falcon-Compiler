The one major issue that came across in the parser was when it was orginially built, it was not recursivly going through for each token 
in the token stream. While it did follow the stream correctly, and output to log when it needed too, it would follow a path from root to
the lowest boiled down form of a rule from our class grammar, and then throw an error for a missing expected right brace. 

After reveiwing what I had written I saw the issue was that certain functions where not calling back, in the example where a statement 
would follow another statement if entered in the input. I started to solve this by putting a call for the statement function after every
keyword statement function and every expression funciton, but that caused another error somewhere that halted the entire parsing process.
I realized it would just be after the call for each statement file where I would have to put the recursive call, and the issue was resolved
with the parser working correctly.
