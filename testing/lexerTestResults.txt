Lexer test results

After writing the lexer and ensuring the javascript worked with the html file, I cam across a number of bugs. 
They are as follows:
    -> $ - not printing/entering token stream unless forgotten at the end of file
    -> $ - after found at end of file and  printing lexer success, the console would still print 'Start lexing program # ...'
    -> keywords - if the first character of a keyword was found as an ID, the token after it would always be printed as the ID again
    -> comments - did not work, froze the page
    -> Multi-line multi-program inputs - if a $ was found at the end of a line, it would not continue to scan the rest of the input
    -> Unrecognized token - if a character not defined by the grammar was found, the page and lexer would freeze due to infinite loop
    -> Multi-program input - if one program failed, lexer would not scan the rest of input following it
    
Most of these issues had simple solutions, and most of those solutions involved the pointer going through each character in a line.
I had place the pointer incrementation in a place were it would either be not executed at the correct position, or caused the lexer to 
continue to scan without restarting the while loop to go through each character. This is also where I started to include the continue
function, to ensure that once the scanner found a token, the pointer would increment and the while loop would start scanner at where the
new pointer was located. 

For other bugs, I found that issues arised from me placing code that would have to be implemented with a functioning parser in tact, which
is not where I am yet. Removing this line (specifically with the multi-program input, a return case in a failed lex) ensured the problem 
when away for now, but when I am finished with the parser I am sure that I will eed to enter that again. For now, the lexer works on its
own, and after the parser is complete they will work together.
